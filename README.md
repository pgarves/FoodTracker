# FoodTracker

CMSC389L Final Project

## Overview

Food Tracker is a web application will allow users to track their food that has been eaten throughout the day.

It will record the foodâ€™s nutritional attributes such as protein, carbohydrates, fiber, calcium, and iron.

It will then suggest other foods for the remainder of the day that allow for the user to get the remaining amount of nutrients for a well balanced diet
